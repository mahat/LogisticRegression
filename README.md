# LogisticRegression
Logistic Regression Examples

# Simple Logistic Regression
- Conducting logistic regression on Titanic Survival Data
- Using L2 normalization
- Creating data frame with feature columns and coefficients and Intercept 
- Showing probabilities of instances to be separated
- Showing how to calculate metrics of model

# Lass Example
- Conducting logistic regression on Smoking dataset
- Using L1 normalization
- Plotting coefficients absolute value map

# Multi-Class Logistic regression
- Using logistic regression multi-class problem
- OneVsAll and OneVsOne multi-class strategies are used and showed
- Voting process showed

# Cross Validation
- Conduction Cross validation on logistic regression model in order to find optimal regularization parameter
- GridSearch and LogisticRegressionCV are used
- Validating model using K-fold cross validation at the end
- Comparing result between models with random selected regularization parameter and carefully selected regularization parameter

# Utils
- In utils.py, you can find reading and munging of Titanic dataset

# Datasets
I used iris from sklearn, titanic from kaggle, smoke from UCI datasets

# Running Cde
- Code is written in Python 2.7.12
- Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib libraries are used
